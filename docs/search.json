    "text": "About the Band\n\n\n\n\nGuid Cause Edinburgh 2009\n\n\n\nFrom ages 17 to 60+, SheBoomers are ordinary women who come from all walks of life – artists, accountants, musicians, teachers, home-makers, doctors, lecturers, students, scientists, care workers and nurses. What binds us is our love of making music with drums, loudly.\nWomen love SheBoom for many reasons. Some of us are attracted to the idea of drumming. The drum is one of the oldest instruments and has often been forbidden to women – we weren’t supposed to play them and they made a lot of noise.\nOthers of us were not so much attracted to just the drumming as to the creative and wonderful energies which comes from making music with other women. Over the years, hundreds of women have been members of SheBoom.\nMembership figures have fluctuated between 40 to a staggering 107 in early 1994. Current membership is around 40.\nHundreds of hours are put into composing, practising and rehearsing for gigs. The band meets every Friday evening from 6.30 to 9pm.\nSheBoom also keeps an important community-based profile by running beginner drumming workshops. New band members are recruited from these workshops. A waiting list is kept for women interested in coming to these workshops. No music experience necessary.\nDeeply rooted in Scottish socialist traditions, the band operates as a self-funded non-profit collective. All sums earned are spent on drumming tuition, hire of rehearsal rooms, purchase and maintenance of instruments, carnival costumes, administration and publicity costs. We have no salaried staff and band members do not derive an income from band earnings."

    "text": "SheBoom grew out of the percussion performance in the spectacular artwork: Keltic Clyde Firewitch – designed and directed by Jane Sutherland and brought to life under the musical direction of Erin Scrutton. Jane and Erin first collaborated planning a Reclaim the Night March in 1989.\nThe Firewitch Project was created for the very first Glasgay! in 1993, a pyrotechnic performance on the Clyde’s old Suspension Bridge at the Witching Time of Samhuinn, passionately engaging the creative efforts of more than 120 women (AND a few men of goodwill). Following the success of this event, the women wouldn’t put down their sticks, and other gigs were played in the Glasgay! Festival. It wasn’t until later on that a band member “coined the term ‘SheBoom’ which seemed to capture the phenomenon of women drumming”. We are one of the first, and were certainly the biggest, all-women drumming bands in Europe and celebrate our 30th birthday in 2023. SheBoom is, we think, Glasgay’s! most enduring and culturally significant sensation.\nOver the years, hundreds of women have been members of SheBoom. We play at marches and protests all across the UK and beyond. SheBoom has played a wide variety of venues ranging from the Royal Albert Hall in London to Drumchapel Shopping Centre and led many marches including those frequently organised by Pride, Reclaim the Night, Scottish Parliament, STUC, CND, Anti-Racism, Women’s Aid, Rape Crisis. We have also been part of the Correfoc in Barcelona and more recently SheBoom have played at the International Women’s Festival, Lesvos, as well as several of the Glasgow-based Olympic and Commonwealth events, and the Women of the World Festival"
